# OOP
Object Oriented Programming Unit

Hello there! This repository is a compilation of things I learned during my object oriented programming unit in my ISC4U class! This repository includes my class notes, my class worksheet examples, as well as my end of unit assignment!

# END OF UNIT ASSIGNMENT

Our assignment for the end of this unit was to utilize everything we learned to create a program that demonstrated our knowledge. For my assignment, I chose to code a Tamagotchi simulator as I was inspired by the Tatsu Discord Bot and the Tatsugotchi function on the bot.
